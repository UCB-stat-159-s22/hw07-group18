    "Metro interstate traffic volume is the hourly traffic volume of metropolitan interstate. For this specific dataset, we are studying the hourly Minneapolis-St Paul, MN traffic volume for westbound I-94 from 2012-10-02 to 2018-9-30. We explore th traffic data for Minneapolis-St Paul and try to explore relationships between temperature, weather conditions, date and time information on Mineeapolis interstate traffic and predict traffic volume given these weather conditions. We therefore build a linear model that examines how the above variables are correlated to traffic volume."

    "Before doing EDA or further data anlysis, it is important to explore and perform data cleaning to check for any irregularities in the dataset and to see if any additional columns are needed. Our original data contains 9 columns and 48,204 rows. Specifically, the explanatory variables are holiday, temperature, amount of rain per hour, amount of snow per hour, coverage of clounds, type of weather, description of weather, and date time. The last column is the response variable traffic_volume.\n",

On the other hand, for most observations, the amount of rain is 0 since there is no rain for most of the times.

    "### Analysis and Interpretation of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our Fit OLS Regression Model that we have built based on our variables, we tried to find a correlation between the level of Traffic and different variables that may influence the level of traffic. According to the summary of our model, we were able to find that there is overall positive correlation between the level of traffic and different environmental variables (snow, cloud, rain, temperature, holiday, weekend) in combined. For some of the unexpected discoveries we had, the most unexpected finding wasthe statistic significance on the snow level. Initially, we assumed that high level of snow would decrease the amount of traffic, but the result we discovered was very different from our expectation. The p-value for this factor came out to be 0.684, which was higher than 0.05. This also signifies that the snow does not have strong correlation on traffic level. For other coefficients on our variables, they were reasonably expected at the beginning of our hypothesis test as we expected that higher rain and snow would decrease the level of traffic. We expected a negative correlation because due to the danger of driving under restraint atmospheric conditions from snow and rain (which could hinder vision and increase chance of accident by less surface friction on the road), we expected less people to drive on those days. Similarly, we expected negative correlation between the traffic level and other variables, such as weekend and holiday, as less people would be driving to commute to work or they would more likely to stay at home. Other surprising foundings we had were correlation between cloud level/Temperature and traffic level as the coefficients were positive, but exceptionally smaller compared to other variables that had positive coefficients. This demonstrates that there are some possitive correlation between these factors, but weaker correlation compared to holiday, rain, snow, and weekend variables. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the interpretation between overall environmental factors and the traffic level, we are confident to say there are overall positive correlation between the combined environmental factors on the level of traffic overall, which can be found from the positive constant coefficient. There were some unexpected discoveries made  on the relationship between the level of traffic and snowiness of the weather, we found strongest correlation between the holiday variable and our target variable (Level of Traffic). Overall, the p-values for most of our variables were statistically significant, except the level of snow, ultimately supporting our hypothesis. "
